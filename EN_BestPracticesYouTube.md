Follow these steps to help ensure that your human rights video is found
by your target audience and by people who can use such video in their
own research, advocacy, and reporting projects.

### Title
Keep titles brief and descriptive. Include the date and location. Use
common words that will help others find the video, i.e., “Deadly Clashes
Amid Garment Factory Workers’ Strike in Phnom Penh, Cambodia 11.13.13”

### Description
Write a description of what happened before, during and after the
recording. Include the date, time, location and relevant links. Provide
context.

### Graphic Footage
If your footage is graphic, write “GRAPHIC IMAGERY” in the video’s title
and description to alert viewers that the video may disturb them.

### Tags
Always include date, time, city, specific location. Use words that
describe the footage such as: ‘pepper spray,’ ‘arrest,’ ‘shelling,’
‘protest’.

### Save
Video sites such as YouTube are great for sharing videos but should not
be used as a place to save video. Valuable forensic information is lost
when files are uploaded and sites like YouTube can delete your footage.
Save copies of original footage and any written documentation on
external hard drives and store them in a secure location.

### Credit
If you are uploading a video that was originally shot or uploaded on
another website or YouTube channel, include a link to the original video
in the description area so that the owner of the video can be contacted
and/or credited by journalists or human rights researchers.

### Creative Commons
Consider selecting a Creative Commons license so that your video can be
remixed, collected and/or archived by others.

### Safety
Think twice before uploading your video if doing so might endanger
people by exposing their identity or location. Once it’s online, you
lose control of the video. Consider contacting a volunteer legal team if
you are unsure about security or legal implications. YouTube’s face
blurring function allows uploaders to obscure identities of individuals
in the video. For instructions on using the app, visit

## The Human Rights Channel
Now that your video is on YouTube, consider submitting it to the Human
Rights Channel
[www.youtube.com/humanrights](www.youtube.com/humanrights) to help it
reach people who can make a difference. The Human Rights Channel curates
verified video on human rights issues and supports those behind the
camera who create it. The Channel is a WITNESS project, powered by
Storyful, hosted on YouTube. To submit your video to the Human Rights
Channel, send a link to your YouTube video on twitter to @ythumanrights
or email a link to your video with basic information about it to
curator@witness.org. If, for security reasons, you cannot upload your
video to your own YouTube channel, you can email the video file to the
curator@witness.org.

### Remember
Uploading a video to an online distribution site like YouTube (or
Facebook or Vimeo) is not the same as archiving your video. See the
Activists’ Guide to Archiving Video for more information about
preserving video files
[http://archiveguide.witness.org](http://archiveguide.witness.org).
